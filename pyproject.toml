description = "NuMeTris is a package for Maximum-Entropy models for triadic pattern detection. It contains known models such as DBCM and RBCM for binary motif analysis, and contain mixture models such as DBCM+CReMa and RBCM+CRWCM for weighted triadic motif analysis. The models are solved and routine are present for numeric ensemble generation and the computation of the triadic z-scores for triadic sub-graph occurrence, average flux and intensity."
